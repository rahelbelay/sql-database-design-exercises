Using the `sql-intro` code for reference, create database projects for each of the following topics:

- pets and owners
- books and authors
- paintings and artists
- teams and players
- cities and states


Please include:

- a `schema.sql` for your `create table` statements
- a `seed.sql` for your `insert into` statements
- `npm` scripts to reset the database as needed ;)
